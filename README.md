## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned `ul` and `ol` tags get their bullets/counters from the browser which makes styling them very limited. I had trouble getting my `ol` bullet vertically centering with longer blocks of text. I ended up having to remove the bullets completely and adding my own custom bullets to manipulate them the way I wanted to. Also for `ol`, I could not figure out how to set a different font family on the provided numbers, so I did the same, removed the list style, and added my own custom counters, where I was able to explore the `counter-reset`, `counter-increment` and `counter()` css properties.

### Continued development

I am focused on creating maintainable and scalable CSS using the default technologies.
